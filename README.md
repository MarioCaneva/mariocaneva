Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mario â€” a sociologist and political scientist with a strong foundation in social theory, political analysis, statistics, and quantitative research methods. I also have a technical background as an electronics technician and formal training in programming. Over the past several months, Iâ€™ve been focused on Python, data science, machine learning, and neural networks, working to connect these tools with critical questions in society and human behavior.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bridging social science and AI through projects on democratic legitimacy, ideological clustering, and the design of personality systems with interactive learning mechanisms that integrate emotional and cognitive dimensions from a semiotic framework.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced topics in neural networks, large language models, and their philosophical and political implications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research and development projects that explore the intersection of AI, democratic systems, mass psychology, and the semiological structures underpinning affective and cognitive responses.
